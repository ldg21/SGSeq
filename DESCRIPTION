Title: Prediction, quantification and visualization of alternative
       transcript events from RNA-seq data

Description: RNA-seq data are informative for the analysis of known and
             novel transcript isoforms. While the short length of RNA-seq
             reads limits the ability to predict and quantify full-length
             transcripts, short read data are well suited for the analysis
             of individual alternative transcripts events (e.g. inclusion
             or skipping of a cassette exon). The SGSeq package enables the
             prediction, quantification and visualization of alternative
             transcript events from BAM files.
